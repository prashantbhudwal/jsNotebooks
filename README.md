# JS Notebooks with Deno

This project is a personal learning project focused on learning JavaScript and TypeScript using Deno-based Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks are in the `.ipynb` format and utilize the Deno kernel for execution.

## Project Structure

- `deno.json`: Configuration file for Deno.
- `example.ipynb`: Example Jupyter Notebook using the Deno kernel.
- `main.ts`: Main TypeScript file.
- `main_test.ts`: Test file for the main TypeScript file.

## Getting Started

1. Install vs code extensions for Jupyter Notebooks and Deno.
2. Install Deno from [deno.land](https://deno.land/).
3. Install the Deno kernel for Jupyter:
   ```sh
   deno jupyter
   ```
4. Open any `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface and start experimenting with JavaScript and TypeScript using the Deno runtime.

## Usage

- Write and execute JavaScript/TypeScript code in the Jupyter Notebook cells.
- Use the Deno runtime for running the code.
